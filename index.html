            is an artificial life program that produces startlingly realistic
            simulations of the flocking behavior of birds. Each "boid" (which is
            an abbreviation of "bird-oid object") follows a very simple set of
            rules. These rules can be summarized as follows:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Separation</strong>: boids move away from other
                    boids that are too close
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Alignment</strong>: boids attempt to match the
                    velocities of their neighbors
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Cohesion</strong>: boids move toward the center of
                    mass of their neighbors
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="margin-top">Project description</h2>
            In this project I've tried to programm my own boids. Some math
            aspects were inspired by the article mentioned in the intorduction
            but modified to fit my requirements. I've also extended the boids
            obstacle abvoidance behaviour in a realistic albeit not
            computationally efficient way.
            <p>
                For the project I've heavily used object oriented programming.

                <iframe
                    src="boids/normal/"
                    frameborder="0"
                    class="right"

                For my first attempt everything is done using vectors. As an
                example separation loops over all nearby boids and adds a vector
                from the current boid to the other boid to a sum. The vectors
                magnitude is the resized proportionally to the amount of nearby
                boids and by some factor. This separation force is then simply
                added to the boids velocity. Cohesion and alignment work in a
                very similar fasion. Steering away from the edges is done by
                adding a vector which points away from the wall to the velocity
                if the boid is within a certain margin of the edge. This means
                that the boids can leave the confines of the screen for a short
                period of time but it is very effective at keeping them inside
                the screen.
                <div>
                    I've extended this type of boid to create a few slightly
                    different simulations:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <a href="boids/normal/">Normal boids</a>: The first
                            boid simulation I made and the one shown here.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <a href="boids/small/">Small boids</a>: The boids
                            are "smaller" which means their perception range is
                            shorter and they appear to fly slower. This means
                            they form a few small flocks on the screen.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <a href="boids/big_flock/">Big flock</a>: This
                            simulation uses the small boids but with a
                            perception range that spans over the entire screen.
                            They form one big flock in the screen. The intricacy
                            here is that they always tend to form a circle where
                            half the boids rotate in one direction whilst the
                            other half rotates in the other direction. This sort
                            of behaviour is not very reminiscent of birds but
                            might show good behaviour for a school of fish.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <a href="boids/grid/">Grid</a>: By organising the
                            boids into grid cells the size of their perception
                            range radius I can ensure that the only other boids
                            which on boid can see are in its cell or the 9
                            adjecent ones. For
                            <a href="boids/extra_small/">larger simulations</a>
                            with much smaller boids this is a big optimization.
                            Granted the simulation looks way worse and the
                            individiual flocking behaviour is almost impossible
                            to see. That's why I stuck with smaller simulations
                            with larger boids. I kept using the grid however
                            since it abstracted some code away which I needed
                            for each simulation.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <a href="boids/obstacles/">Circular obstacle</a>:
                            For this simulation I made the boids steer away from
                            the obstacle in the center if they are heading
                            straight for it. This resulted in the most realistic
                            looking obstacle avoidance but it can happen that
                            boids get pushed into the obstacle. This is usually
                            the case if the boid is flying close to a tangent
                            line and gets pushed into it by separation forces.
                        </li>

                </div>

            <h2 class="margin-top">Obstacle avoiding boid</h2>

                <span class="img-desc">Boid with its vision rays</span>
            </div>
            For this simulation I wanted the boids to steer away from obstacles
            instead of just adding a vector away from the obstacle to their
            velocity. This could intern be extended so the boids see each other
            as obstacle and also steer away from each other. To start things off
            I gave each boid vision rays as seen in the image. Those rays would
            then need to find intersections with other lines on the screen. I
            wanted these other lines to be normal lines and circles. For the
            line one line intersection I tried calculating the formula myself
            and got very close to getting it to work. However there was a small
            bug left and for the life of me I couldn't figure it out. So I ended
            up using the formula I found on
            <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line%E2%80%93line_intersection"
                target="_blank"
                rel="noopener noreferrer"
                >Wikipedia</a
            >. With that I had line-line intersections working. You can check it
            out in <a href="/boids/line_test/">this demo</a>. For the
            line-circle intersection I went straight to the internet and found a
            nicely working formula on
            <a
                href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Circle-LineIntersection.html"
                target="_blank"
                rel="noopener noreferrer"
                >wolfram.com</a
            >. Here's the <a href="boids/circle_test/">demo</a> for that. When a
            boid detects an obstacle on one of its rays it steers away from it.
            Like mentioned above I wanted to treat each boid as an obstacle in
            circular shape. However this turned out to be horrendously slow as
            each ray of each boid had to check if it intersected with each other
            boid in its near vicinity. This aproach turned out well-ish to
            confine the boid in the screen. If the boid steered with about a 45°
            angle onto two line obstacle in a 90° angle it could wiggle its way
            out of the screen. This is shown in the video.

                ></video>
                <span>
                    To fix this I smoothed out the edges by adding a third
                    obstacle in each corner such that an isosceles triangle is
                    formed. This however further decreased the performance as
                    each ray now had to check double the obstacles for
                    collisions. The solution was pretty effective at keeping the
                    boids within the screen except for some rare edgecases where
                    they got pushed out by other boids. As this simulation is so
                    expensive to run I have not embeded it, but you can find it

                As my last simulation I've descided to add a predatory boid to
                chase the other prey boids. My goal was that the predator chases
                the boids until they are forced to split up their flock whilst
                trying to avoid the predator.
                <p>
                    The predators are stripped of all their flocking behaviour
                    and follow only one goal: To steer towards the center of
                    mass of the prey boids they can see. Predators have a hunger
                    parameter which increases by 0.1% each timestep. If that
                    hunger parameter reaches a value of 200% they die. They can
                    lower their hunger meter by killing and eating other boids.
                    To do that they must come close enough to a boid for it to
                    be in their killing range. A predators speed and ability to
                    quickly change direction increases as they get hungrier.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The prey try to steer away from the nearest predator they
                    see whilst keeping their flocking behaviour.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After tweaking some parameters I had a decent looking
                    simulation where the predator is sometimes able to cleanly
                    split the flock of boids. In this simulation I only have one
                    predator and if he happens to die the simulation gets reset
                    after five seconds.
